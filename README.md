# Midterm Project - Final Page

My site uses Sections and Containers to organize Organisms. The div names specify what part of the organism it is, whether it be an image or text. The numbers next to the name correlates to where the element is displayed on the page such as container4. The CSS is also organized in order displayed on the page

All images used are mine I took of my cat
